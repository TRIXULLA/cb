                      <h2> Spices</h2>
                      <p>Spices have long been prized in Sri Lanka. Cinnamon which is endemic to Sri Lanka is the most well-known. Spice and ivory dealers from all over the world who arrived in Sri Lanka in the 15th and 16th centuries carried their local cuisines with them, resulting in a wide diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice is cooked in stock with a particular curry and frikkadels, then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-inspired Sri Lankan meal. Sweets from the Netherlands and Portugal are still popular. Roast beef and roast chicken are examples of British influence. The influence of Indian cooking methods and cuisine has significantly impacted what Srilanka has today.</p>

                          A large majority of gem deposits found in Sri Lanka are sedimentary in nature. 
                          More than 90% of the island is made up of Precambrian metamorphic rocks.Over the 
                          past few million years, intense weather and rapid erosion have given rise to thick 
                          and extensive accumulations of sediments in the flood plains of rivers, in lakes, 
                          and in now-buried river channels in the Highland complex. It is within these 
                          weathering products that significant secondary-alluvial-gem deposits are collected.
                           Except for a few alluvial occurrences in the Eastern Vijayan Complex, virtually all
                            Sri Lankan gem deposits have been found within the Highland and to a lesser extent 
                            Southwest Groups.
