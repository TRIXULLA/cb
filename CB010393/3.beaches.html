Pasikuda is the pin up of picture postcard beaches thanks to its soft white sand and translucent water. Between May and September, this is the best place in Sri Lanka for a Sri Lankan beach holiday. Most days are cloudless, the ocean is warm, and water clarity is very good which makes it ideal for snorkelling, diving, sailing and a host of other water sports. The curve of Pasikuda bay means that swimming can be enjoyed throughout the year. Pasikuda is a relatively new destination in Sri Lanka for luxury beach holidays and the resorts lining Pasikuda, such as Uga Bay, all benefit from generous manicured gardens, wide-open beachfronts and the most surreal ocean views. The original village of Pasikuda with its guesthouses, hawker stalls and fishing boats infuse local flavor to the south of the bay. During the high season, jet skis, kayaks and sailing boats occupy the water.

                        <p>
                            Arugambay is a dramatically beautiful, with bright white sand and deep blue water gradually becoming green the closer you get to the shore. With that beauty comes some of the best surf breaks in Sri Lanka, and the beach is known as an international surf destination. This reputation brings many visitors but also means the area has a good tourist infrastructure and is easy to access. The curving beach feels a bit like a Hawaiian beach - the area near the water slopes down, and there's a dry, sandy section, then rougher areas with shrubs and a tree line.

                            Mirissa is the largest fishing port on the south coast and sits right on the southern tip of the island. Its beauty and relative proximity to Colombo (the capital city) mean it's not hard to access. It's about a two-hour drive from the capital's airport. The small beach town and its large beach are beautiful, backed by a dense grove of palm trees. The town is on a little hill that rises up behind the beach.
